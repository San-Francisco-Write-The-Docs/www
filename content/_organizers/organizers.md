## The Jobs that Meetup Organizers Do

These are the roles that have to be filled for every meetup. You're allowed to fill more than one role for the same meetup (it's not mandatory, but nobody will stop you if you want to do more).

### Planning tasks

* *Program Planner* - Plans an event by finding a topic and speaker. Puts together the program for the evening. Writes the event description. Answers questions about the event on Meetup.com and other social media.
* *Venue planner* - Finds corporate sponsors to provide a venue and food. Collects information about the venue for the event listing.
* *Promotions planner* - Promotes events by multiple platforms and builds an audience for the Twitter account by posting between meetups.
* *Supercoordinator* - Schedules regular meetings to monitor and track progress toward each event. Leads discussions about planning and problem-solving. Drives the planning process forward by allocating people where they are needed to handle planning tasks and solve problems.

### Day-of-event tasks

* *Emcee* - Opens and closes the meeting, makes WTD-related announcements, acknowledges sponsors and introduces the speaker.
* *Greeter* - Speaks to every attendee to make sure that everyone feels welcomed and, hopefully, that people decide to keep attending if they're new. Helps guests find name badges and refreshments. Answers questions (about careers, tools, etc.) or finds the person who can answer them. Guides attendees from the front door of the building to the event, when needed. Sets up furniture in the event space, when needed, and puts it back. Performs light cleanup after events, to make sure spaces are as nice as before we used them.
* *Technology manager* - Handles audio and video equipment. Manages a Webex call during events.
