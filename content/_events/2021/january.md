## A Special Event by Portland Write The Docs

With the deadline for Write the Docs Portland 2021 (virtual) quickly approaching on January 25, 2021, this is a great opportunity to share your proposal ideas, conjure ideas for proposals, and support our fellow Documentarians who are submitting proposals.

The Portland Write the Docs chapter has run this proposal workshop for several years. Now that the conference is virtual, they're bringing the workshop to the entire community! (Write The Docs San Francisco Bay area is cross-listing, so our members can join in.)

As Portland community has numerous past speakers and conference volunteers, this is a great opportunity to ask questions about the conference proceedings and the submission process.

If you want to "pitch" your proposal, send a message to an organizer. If there's space, we'll get you on the agenda.

To learn more about the Call for Proposals, go to: https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/cfp/.

Write the Docs includes a template for proposals here: https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/example-proposal/

Privacy note: we plan to record this event.

IMPORTANT: RSVP by 4 p.m. January 19th (a day before the event) and we'll send the Zoom link on the day of the event.

We're an inclusive, caring group. Please take a moment to read the Write the Docs Code of Conduct: https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/
