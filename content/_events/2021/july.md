## Learn how Python can positively impact your writing career

Good sample code is often the best documentation. Even if your paragraphs and lists are clear, programmers still prefer good code samples. After all, text and code are different languages, and it's code that the reader ultimately cares about.

Please join us as Adam Wood presents how learning Python has positively impacted his tech writing career, leading to more and better opportunities in the field, including his current job at Google. The talk will briefly introduce the language itself, highlight its value to tech writers in particular, and provide resources for learning.

OUR SPEAKER:

Adam Wood is a Technical Writer at Google, on TensorFlow's Developer Relations team. He focuses on machine learning in production settings. Before Google, he worked at Facebook, Intel, O'Reilly Media, Open Data Kit, WhoIsHostingThis, and several startups. He's also a composer, poet, hymn writer, and church musician.
