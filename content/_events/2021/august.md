## Learn to spar with your content to create quality documentation

Design sparring is the most powerful tool a content designer has for shipping quality work. But getting stakeholders in one place is tricky, and what you do when you’re there even more so. Sparring can definitely increase your heart rate—so let’s figure out how to make sure your heart races from excitement, not fear.

Please join us as John Paz presents how to use artifacts that come from a sparring session to inform your work. John will talk about what design sparring is, and what it’s for, as well as share some stories about some high-stake sparring sessions so you can see what went right, and in some cases what could go wrong.

### Our speaker:
John Paz has over 15 years of professional writing and editing experience, and a passion for simplifying the complex. He is a content-focused design professional with experience writing for a wide range of audiences—including highly technical audiences, like developers.
