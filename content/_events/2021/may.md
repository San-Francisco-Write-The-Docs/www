Metrics, data, analytics - whatever your organization calls it, we often need to measure our docs. Measure quality, measure quantity, measure coverage, measure success... but how, and which measurements carry meaning?

Come with your questions, your suggestions, or your stories of what has and hasn't worked for you.
