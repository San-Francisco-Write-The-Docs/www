## Learn strategies for writing useful and meaningful sample code

AWS offers 250+ data processing, storage and computational services. A large proportion of its customers interact with these services using code rather than through the AWS Console, and they want (need!) example code to enable them do so successfully.

Please join us as Brian Murray talks through the challenges inherent in creating and publishing easily discoverable high-quality code examples to a large customer base with diverse requirements and skill-levels.

OUR SPEAKER:

 Brian Murray is a Documentation Manager at AWS, responsible for the AWS SDK Code Examples team. His role is to guide the team’s effort to deliver a best-of-class AWS SDK Code Examples library across all AWS Services in all AWS supported SDK languages. Before joining AWS, he was a Technical Writer with numerous companies, including SAP and Misys. He’s also a drama facilitator, especially interested in Theatre of the Oppressed.
