## Write The Docs wants YOU to give a lightning talk! ##

 This month, we invite you to prepare a talk on your process for writing technical documentation. Where do you start? What tips do you have? We want to learn from you.

Lightning talks are short presentations no more than 5 minutes long. You can speak with or without slides -- it’s your choice.

## Tips for preparing a lightning talk ##

Ideally, a lightning talk focuses on a concept in a quick and clear manner. Keep in mind that you can be as serious or as silly as you like.

You can use slides, but you’ll probably want 15 or fewer unless you plan to [click through them quickly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha).

If you’re not used to public speaking, keep two things in mind:
The audience is on your side and wants you to succeed
Five minutes goes by FAST.

For tips about creating lightning talks, see Barrie Byron’s [So you want to give a lightning](https://barriebyron.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/so-you-want-to-give-a-lightning-talk/]) blog post.
