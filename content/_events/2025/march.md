## Talk title #1: My Favorite Derivatives

**Description:** This is a fun little etymology talk about my favorite Latin derivatives (English words that are derived from Latin). I give a tiny bit of background on Latin as a language, then move into my favorite derivatives, and what it is about their Latin roots that makes me see the English word differently.

**Speaker:** Lena Chervin


## Talk title #2: Docs as Tests: No More Broken Docs
**Description:** Outdated docs break user trust, and drive users away. No one wants that. Docs as Tests treats documentation as literal assertions of product behavior to catch issues before your users do. Come learn about it!

**Speaker:** Manny Silva
