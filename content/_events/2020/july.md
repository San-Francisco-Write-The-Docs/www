## Join the Conversation
Here are some of the things we'll talk about:

* How the project came about and how Tom Manshreck became involved.
* What is the role of a curator? (It looks a lot like a kind of book editor.)
* What is the process of assembling a book for O'Reilly, and how did it come out differently than you expected?
* It's not easy to assemble a book with numerous contributors. Could you talk about any challenges and how you made it work?
* Were there any lessons for you about helping engineers to write for a general audience?
* Are there any lessons that you would pass on to engineers who want to write?
OUR SPEAKER: Tom Manshreck is a staff technical writer for Google and a key contributor to the book "Software Engineering at Google
