Erin McKean will speak about templates for documentation and her activities with The Good Docs Project, a group that aims to create templates for building or improving all sorts of documentation.

Erin will cover the following:

* Why do templates make better documentation?
* Where can templates for documentation be found?
* What should you do if you can't find a template?

In a working session after the talk, visit one or more of these tables:

* Get started contributing to The Good Docs Project.
* Get help from The Good Docs Project to start or tune up a documentation project.
* Join a round table discussion of documentation issues. Bring your questions and get feedback from other attendees. (And answer questions when you can.)

OUR SPEAKER:
Erin McKean is the Docs Advocacy Program Manager in the Open Source Programs Office at Google. You may also know her as the founder of the not-for-profit Wordnik.com, the world’s biggest online dictionary. Before founding Wordnik, she was the editor-in-chief of American Dictionaries for Oxford University Press, and before Javascript, she dabbled in HyperCard, Perl, and Omnimark (if you have ever written anything in Omnimark, she will buy you a drink). In addition to writing code, blog posts, and documentation, she’s also the author of the Weird and Wonderful Words books, the best-selling novel The Secret Lives of Dresses, and The Hundred Dresses, a field guide to dresses, and is an honorary fellow of the Society for Technical Communication. She blogs at dressaday.com. When you meet her, please tell her your favorite word.
