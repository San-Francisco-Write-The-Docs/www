Erin McKean will speak about templates for documentation and her activities with [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), a group that aims to create templates for building or improving all sorts of documentation.

Erin will cover the following:

*   Why do templates make better documentation?
*   Where can templates for documentation be found?
*   What should you do if you can't find a template?

In a working session after the talk, visit one or more of these tables:

*   Get started contributing to The Good Docs Project.
*   Get help from The Good Docs Project to start or tune up a documentation project.
*   Join a round table discussion of documentation issues. Bring your questions and get feedback from other attendees. (And answer questions when you can.)
