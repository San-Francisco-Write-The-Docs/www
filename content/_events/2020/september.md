## Learn How to Use GitHub for Open Source Projects

Details

Github is a very common version control interface used to collaborate on code, documentation, and other content, especially for the web. In this class, you will learn how to find and contribute to open source projects using the GitHub website UI.

The workshop will be a mix of slides and guided exercises. This is a great workshop for tech writers, designers, or anyone who’d like to get familiar with Github and dip their toe in open source.

Topics covered:
• What's the difference between Git and Github?
• Users, organizations, and repositories
• Issues and labels
• Adding and editing a file using the Github UI
• Making a change to multiple files at a time
• Creating and merging a Pull Request
