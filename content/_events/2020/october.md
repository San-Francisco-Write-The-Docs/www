Clay Murphy noticed some time ago that there was potential for improvement in some of Android's internal documentation. He made a pitch to work on those resources full time and it was accepted. Then before the work was done, he realized that the documentation would be even more useful if it were available outside of Google -- so he pitched that too.  At our October 22 meetup, Clay will talk about both parts of the journey, improving the documentation and preparing it to transition from internal documentation to publicly available external documentation.

OUR SPEAKER:
Clay Murphy is a trained journalist and former newspaper reporter who has worked the past 22 years as a technical writer or technical writing manager at companies such as Excite@Home, Red Hat, and Google.
For the last seven years, Clay has been a part of the Android team, first managing the Android Open Source Project website (source.android.com) and then handling all partner-restricted materials with a team of excellent writers.
Two years ago, Clay left management to focus upon internal documentation as a writer full time. Since then, he has helped take the following previously restricted materials public:
