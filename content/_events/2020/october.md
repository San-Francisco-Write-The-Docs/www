OUR SPEAKER:
Clay Murphy is a trained journalist and former newspaper reporter who has worked the past 22 years as a technical writer or technical writing manager at companies such as Excite@Home, Red Hat, and Google.

For the last seven years, Clay has been a part of the Android team, first managing the Android Open Source Project website source.android.com and then handling all partner-restricted materials with a team of excellent writers. And the last couple of years, he's been on a mission to take previously internal Android information public.

Clay's here to talk about that project today.
