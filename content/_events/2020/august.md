## Postman for documentation

Postman, the platform for API developers with components for designing, testing and documenting, is the subject of our August meetup.

Joyce Lin will talk about how you can use Postman to deliver documentation and explore APIs.

Joyce is a senior developer advocate with Postman, a platform used by more than 11 million people and more than 500,000 companies to access bazillions of APIs every month. For many, Postman is an everyday companion that helps them visualize and test APIs more efficiently.

In her spare time, Joyce enjoys coding, cats, and laughing at her own jokes.
