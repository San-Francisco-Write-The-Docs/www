## Write The Docs wants YOU to give a lightning talk!

Lightning talks are short presentations no more than 5 minutes long. You can speak with or without slides -- it’s your choice. Here are some suggestions:

*   Share something you are currently working on
*   Get feedback on a challenge you’re facing
*   Talk about a tool or process you’re using
*   Polish your presentation skills

## Tips for preparing a lightning talk

*   Ideally a lightning talk focuses on one concept in a quick and clear manner. It could be a favorite bit of writing advice, an authoring tool tip, a UX messaging concept, a tidbit of Agile for docs methodology that you live by...or any one of a thousand other things. What's on your mind this week?
*   The subject should be relevant to the WTD audience. Keep in mind, however, that you can be as serious or as silly as you like.
*   You can use slides, but you'll probably want 15 or fewer unless you plan to click through them quickly ([PechuKucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha)).
*   If you're not used to public speaking, keep two things in mind:
    *   The audience is on your side and wants you to succeed
    *   Five minutes goes by FAST.

At conferences, lightning talks are the second most popular presentation type, after the keynote presentation. They're a favorite because in addition to hearing many speakers in a single time slot, the audience learns many facts in a short time.
