## Learn from the authors who wrote the book about documentation


Join a panel of Splunk documentarians as they present four lightning talks based on their book, "The Product is Docs." The presenters will each take a few minutes to highlight key points from the chapters on Working with User Experience and Design, Customer Feedback and Community, and Technical Editing. The final lightning talk will describe the XP-inspired writing process for the chapter on Writing SaaS Documentation. After the lightning rounds, there will be plenty of time for Q&A and discussion.

OUR PRESENTERS:

* Chris Gales, Senior Director of Documentation
* Matt Ness, Principal Technical Writer
* Mike Glauser, Staff Technical Writer
* Jessie Evans, Senior Staff Technical Editor
* Jennifer J. Black, Senior Staff Technical Writer
