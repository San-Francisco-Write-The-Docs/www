## Crowdsource your questions

Let's talk about the best strategies to handle the challenges many or all of us face. It could be finding gigs or hiring people, learning new tools, or getting information from teammates. It could be something more complex, like choosing a CMS.
Bring your questions and your know-how. We'll start by collecting at least one question from each attendee. Then we'll sort them and work our way through the list.

RSVP no later than Nov. 11th (the day before the event), and we will send you a Zoom link by email. Make sure you have enabled notifications from meetup.com.
