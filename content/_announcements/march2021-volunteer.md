## Be an organizer for Write The Docs SF Bay Area

Our local meetup is driven by volunteers, and you can be one of them.

If you've ever considered coordinating WTD meetups, now is the time to sign up.

All you have to do to get started is reach out the current organizers:

* Message one of us in the WTD Slack group
* Join the #bayarea-sf-org channel on Slack
* Speak up during a meetup.

For more about what organizers do, go to [this page](https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/meetups/blob/master/organizers%20Handbook/roles-for-organizers.md)
