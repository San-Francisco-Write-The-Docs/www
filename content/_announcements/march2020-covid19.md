The spread of Coronavirus upended plans for Write The Docs Bay Area this week, as it already has for most companies in the Bay Area.

We're working to transform our meetups into online seminars for at least the next two months. Those events will be advertised on this site and will also still appear on meetup.com for the foreseeable future.

Bay Area organizers still plan to set up an event every month this year, except December.

Meanwhile, Write The Docs Portland issued a [covid-19 update](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/news/covid-19-update-01/) on March 3: The conference is still on, but documentarians are urged to stay home if they are sick or might have been exposed to the virus.

The announcement says, in part:
"If at the time of Write the Docs Portland 2020 you feel sick or are worried that you might have been in contact with people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, we encourage you to stay home. Your registration will be 100% refunded. If you have any questions about this, please reach out to portland@writethedocs.org."

It also asks potential attendees to monitor announcements from the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx).
