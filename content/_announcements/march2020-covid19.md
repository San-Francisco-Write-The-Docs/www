The spread of Coronavirus is forcing organizers for Write The Docs to change plans in the Bay Area and in Portland, for the safety of WTD members.

We're working to transform Bay Area meetups into online events for at least the next two months. The March event will still feature Camtasia, but will be hosted virtually and will take place at a later date in order to allow time for replanning.

Bay Area organizers still plan to set up an event every month this year, except December, and the events will be advertised on this site and will also still appear on meetup.com for the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, Write The Docs Portland [announced](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/news/covid-19-update-02/) on March 10 that the flagship conference is postponed, probably until August. They plan to announce the new date by March 20.

They also ask attendees to monitor announcements from the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx) as the event approaches.
