## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Write The Docs Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@writethedocs-sfbay.org](mailto:support@writethedocs-sfbay.org).


## What should I know before I get started?

### Jekyll and Markdown

writethedocs-sfbay.org is built using Jekyll, a ruby-based static site generator (check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)!). We recommend that you first familiarize yourself with Jekyll before working on this project. 

Jekyll converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML. Most of our website's content is in markdown. We use the [Kramdown flavor](kramdown.getalong.com) of Markdown.  

### Directory Structure

We use the core Jekyll directories (_data, _includes, _layouts) as standard Jekyll. Instead of "posts", we use "collections". Our collections are housed within the "content" directory. 

Our content collections are as follows:

* About (content/_about): This collection contains all of our about us content.
* Announcements (content/_announcements): This collection contains all of our non-event related announcements.
* Events (content/_events): This collection contains all of our event announcements. 
* Organizers (content/_organizers): This collection contains all of our externally-facing documentation for organizers in our meetup group.

### Templates

There are templates available for announcements and events. Please use these when creating new announcements and events to ensure that you have the appropriate front matter and components for theses documents.

* [Announcement template](https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/www/blob/master/content/_announcements/_template.md)
* [Event template](https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/www/blob/master/content/_events/_template.md)
